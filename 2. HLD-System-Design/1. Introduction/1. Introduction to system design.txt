What is system design ?

-> system design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.
-> It involves making high-level decisions about scalability, reliability, performance, and maintainability of the system.
-> Used in real world applications like designing scalable web applications, distributed systems, databases, etc.


Why is system design important?
-> Scalabilty and reliability :- Ensures that the systems handle millions of users and requests without failure.
-> Architectural thinking :- Goes beyond coding involves trade-offs like CAP theorem, SQL vs NoSQL, etc.
-> Real world problem solving :- Helps in building actual sytems that can handle real-world challenges.
-> Trade-offs and decision making :- Balances scalability , cost , speed, and complexity.
-> Future-proofing :- Prevent bottlenecks and allows for growth and changes in requirements.

What is DNS ?
-> The "Phonebook" of the Internet
-> Translates human-readable domain names to IP addresses
DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system used to translate human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1). This process is essential for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.

Why is DNS important ?
-> Enables users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names
-> Facilitates email delivery by translating domain names into IP addresses
-> Supports load balancing and redundancy through DNS records 

Types of DNS servers
-> Root Name Servers: The top-level DNS servers that know where to find the authoritative servers for each top-level domain (TLD) like .com, .org, etc.
-> TLD Name Servers: Responsible for specific top-level domains, directing queries to the appropriate authoritative servers.
-> Authoritative Name Servers: The DNS servers that hold the actual DNS records for a domain, providing answers to queries about that domain.
-> Recursive Resolvers: These servers act as intermediaries, receiving queries from clients and recursively querying other DNS servers until they find the authoritative answer.

DNS Caching and Performance optimization
-> Why is caching important?
Caching is crucial in DNS to reduce latency and improve performance. When a DNS resolver receives a query, it checks its cache first. If the answer is found, it returns the cached result, avoiding the need to query other servers. This speeds up the resolution process and reduces the load on DNS servers.

-> Where caching occurs?
Caching occurs at various levels in the DNS hierarchy:
1. Browser cache (stores previous DNS lookups)
2. Operating system cache (stores DNS lookups for applications)
3. DNS resolver cache (stores DNS lookups for a specific resolver)

-> Time to Live (TTL)
Determines how long a cached record is valid .


The DNS Resolution Process
1. User enters a domain name in a web browser.
2. The browser checks its local cache for the IP address.
3. Operating system checks its DNS cache.
4. Query to local DNS resolver (ISP or configured DNS server).
5. if not found , query is sent to the root DNS servers.
6. TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers provide the authoritative DNS server details.
7. The authoritative DNS server responds with the IP address for the domain.
8. The resolver caches the response and returns the IP address to the browser.
9. The browser uses the IP address to establish a connection to the web server.

Important of DNS in large scale systems
-> Ensuring high availability : 
   1. Load balancing using DNS records (e.g., round-robin DNS).
   2. Anycast DNS for faster global resolution.
-> DNS failover strategies:
   1.Primary and secondary DNS servers for redundancy.
-> CDN (Content Delivery Network) & DNS:
   1. How DNS directs users to the nearest CDN edge server for faster content delivery.
-> DNS security risks :
   1. DNS poisoning , cache poisoning attacks and DDOS attacks.

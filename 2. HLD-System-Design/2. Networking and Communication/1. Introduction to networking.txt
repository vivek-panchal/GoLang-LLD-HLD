What is networking?
-> Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share resources and information.
-> It involves the design, implementation, and management of networks, including hardware, software, protocols, and services.
-> Used in real world applications like internet connectivity, intranets, cloud computing, etc.

Why is networking matters in system design	?
-> Every system relies on data exchange between components, and networking enables this communication.
-> Networking enables scalability , reliability, and performance of systems.
-> Key areas where networking plays a crucial role :
   1. Communication: Ensuring smooth data transfer between clients , server and databases.
   2. Load balancing : Distributing traffic efficiently to prevent overload on a single server.
   3. Security: Protecting data from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
   4. Efficiency: Optimizing network performance to reduce latency and improve user experience.

How networking impacts large-scale systems?
-> Helps handle millions of users and devices concurrently.
-> Enables fast and reliable data transfer across distributed systems.
-> Reduce latency and improve system resilience.
-> Essential for cloud computing and distributed systems.

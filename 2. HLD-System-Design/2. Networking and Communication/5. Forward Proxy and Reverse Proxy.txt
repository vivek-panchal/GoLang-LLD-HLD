What is a Proxy ?
-> A proxy is an intermediary server between a client and a destination server.
-> Proxy helps with security , caching , traffic control , and anonymity.
-> Proxies can be classified into two main types: forward proxies and reverse proxies.

1. Forward Proxy:
-> Sits between the client and the internet ( used by clients ).
-> Clients connect to the forward proxy instead of directly accessing the website.
-> Can filter content , provide anonymity , and cache requests.
-> Commonly used in corporate networks to control and monitor employee internet usage.
-> Use cases:
   - Privacy and Anonymity: Hiding the user IP address.
   - Content Filtering: Blocking access to certain websites.
   - Caching: Reduce redundant requests and improve load times , speed up browsing.

2. Reverse Proxy:
-> Sits between the internet and the web server ( used by servers ).
-> Clients dont directly communicate with backend servers , requests go through the reverse proxy.
-> Used for load balancing , security , SSL termination and caching.
-> Common use cases:
   - Load Balancing: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers.
   - SSL Termination: Offloading SSL decryption/encryption from backend servers.
   - Caching: Storing responses to reduce load on backend servers.
   - Security and DDoS Protection: Hiding backend server details and filtering malicious traffic.


Differences between Forward Proxy and Reverse Proxy:
| Aspect               | Forward Proxy                          | Reverse Proxy                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Location             | Between client and internet           | Between internet and web server      |	
| Primary Users        | Clients                               | Servers                              |
| Purpose              | Anonymity, content filtering, caching | Load balancing, SSL termination, caching, security |
| Traffic Direction   | Client to server                      | Server to client                     |
| Example Use Cases    | Corporate networks, personal privacy  | Web hosting, CDN, security services   |

In summary , forward proxies are used by clients to access the internet with added privacy and control , while reverse proxies are used by servers to manage incoming traffic and enhance performance and security.
